# Purpose: Check that user correctly issued some Linux commands
#          using EXTENDED RE  on their matrix server. If the errors, then the
#          checking script will provide feedback to correct the problem.
#          If no errors, then a congratulatory message will be displayed
#          so that the user can proceed to the next section.
