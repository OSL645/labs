# Purpose: Check that user correctly created hard links
#          on their matrix server. If the errors, then the
#          checking script will provide feedback to correct the problem.
#          If no errors, then a congratulatory message will be displayed
#          so that the user can proceed to the next section.

# Function to indicate OK (in green) if check is true; otherwise, indicate
# WARNING (in red) if check is false and end with false exit status
